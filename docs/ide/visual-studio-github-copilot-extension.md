# What is the GitHub Copilot extension for Visual Studio?

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

[**GitHub Copilot**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilotvs) is an AI-powered pair programmer extension for Visual Studio that provides you with context-aware code completions, suggestions, and even entire code snippets. This powerful tool helps developers write code more efficiently, reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks, and minimize errors.

## How GitHub Copilot works

GitHub Copilot works by utilizing advanced machine learning models trained on a vast dataset of publicly available code from GitHub repositories. As you type code, the AI analyzes the context and provides relevant suggestions in real-time. You can receive suggestions also by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do.

You can also use GitHub Copilot to convert comments to code, create unit tests, create SQL queries, and more. 

## How GitHub Copilot compares to IntelliSense and IntelliCode

Here's a detailed look at what each technology can do for you:

- **[IntelliSense](using-intellisense.md)** is a code completion feature built-in to Visual Studio, which provides suggestions based on the current context. Such suggestions include variable names, functions, and classes. IntelliSense is language-specific and works with a limited set of programming languages.
- **[IntelliCode](/visualstudio/intellicode/)** is an extension for Visual Studio that uses AI to provide more intelligent whole line completions based on patterns found in your codebase. It goes beyond IntelliSense by analyzing your code to understand common practices and recommend suggestions accordingly.
- **[GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilotvs)** is an AI-powered code completion extension for Visual Studio that leverages a vast dataset of publicly available code to provide context-aware code suggestions, snippets, and even entire functions. It works with many programming languages and offers more advanced assistance compared to IntelliCode and IntelliSense.
 
While all three aim to improve developer productivity, GitHub Copilot stands out with its ability to understand the context of your code and provide more accurate and relevant suggestions. 

## Prerequisites & supported programming languages

To get started, you need:
+ Visual Studio 2022 [version 17.6](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-history) or later
+ a GitHub Copilot [subscription](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot). 

  > [!TIP]
  > GitHub Copilot is free for verified students and for maintainers of popular open source projects on GitHub.

GitHub Copilot supports several programming languages and frameworks, including but not limited to: C#, C++, and Python.
